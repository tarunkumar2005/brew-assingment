# NOTE: Deployment is handled automatically by Vercel
# Vercel watches the main branch and deploys on every push
# This CI pipeline ensures tests pass before the code reaches main
#
# Workflow:
# 1. Create a PR -> CI runs tests
# 2. Tests pass -> Merge PR to main
# 3. Vercel auto-deploys from main branch
